Void pointer is a pointer wich has no associated data type.
	- It can point to any data of any data type and can be typecasted to any type
	- We cannot dereference a void pointer. --> Error message
	
Use of void pointer
	- malloc and calloc returns a void pointer. Due to this reason, they can

Null pointer is a pointer that does not point to any memory location. Represents
an invalid memory location.
When a NULL value is assigned to a pointer, then the pointer is considered as NULL
pointer.
	- Useful for handling errors when using malloc funct.
	- Initialize pointers.
	- The value of NULL is 0.

A dangling pointer is a pointer wich points to some non-existing memory location.
	- free (ptr) --> ptr = NULL;

Wild pointers are also known as uninitialized pointers. 


Dynamic memory --> Heap, runtime
Static memory --> stack, compile time

Memory allocated by calloc is initialized to 0.

Self Referential Structure is a structure wich contains a pointer to a structure of
the same type.
